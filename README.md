# Learning PyTorch
This is a daily journal of my begineer's journey into PyTorch and Deep Neural Networks. Have a good read!
## Day 1
Didn't dive into PyTorch qute yet
Today I revised the maths behind linear and logistic regression, foundation algorithms for neural networks:
* Gradient Descent
* Matrix Dot product

I also got to write code to implement these - _check it out in PTD 1.ipynb_
